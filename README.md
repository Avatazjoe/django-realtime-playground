Django Realtime Playground
==========================

This is a set of experiments with different modern realtime libraries and
asynchronous servers/frameworks together with Django. Personally I suggest using
[Centrifuge](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge) to add real-time on your
Django site.

Includes:

* Django application - simple chat for authenticated users - every user can write messages, every user can remove any message. 
* A set of async servers which run on different port and listen to connections from chat application.

At this moment there are some possible implementations of chat's realtime part using one of javascript libraries and one of async backend server:

* Node.js server + Socket.IO library
* Node.js server + Sock.js lib
* Python Tornado + Socket.IO
* Python Tornado + Sock.js
* Python Cyclone + jQuery Eventsource lib


Install and run
===============

1) Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FZambia/django-realtime-playground.git django-realtime-playground/
cd django-realtime-playground
```

2) I suppose that you are familiar with virtualenv. Let's run our Django application:

```bash
pip install -r django/requirements.txt
cd django
# for django < 1.7
python manage.py syncdb
# for django >= 1.7 use migrate command
# python manage.py migrate
```

Create new superuser and run server:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Go to `http://localhost:8000` and make sure that everything works.

3) As you can see after successful login into Django site - you can choose one of options how chat will work.
Choose one.

But before you click 'READY' button you must run appropriate async server. Look at folders - they named
exactly as options. Now I should tell you how to run each of those servers.

* Node.js + Socket.IO. To run this you should have Node installed.
```bash
cd node-socketio
npm install
node server.js
```
Now you have node server on port 8001.
	
* Node.js + Sock.js. Same as Node + Socket.IO.

* Tornado + Socket.IO
```bash
cd tornado-sockeio
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

* Tornado + Sock.js. Same as Tornado + Socket.IO

* Cyclone + Eventsource.
```bash
cd cyclone-eventsource
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash server.sh
```

4) After running appropriate async server you can click on button 'READY' and proceed to chat. Chat behaviour is the same for any of options selected–≤

By default every async server will run on port 8001, but you can easily change it in code. But do not forget to change `ASYNC_BACKEND_URL` in Django's `settings.py`

How it works.
-------------

We can not allow bidirectional communication between client and async server because of authorization. So every event you create
goes to Django. Then Django makes POST request to async server which broadcasts those event to all connected clients.
